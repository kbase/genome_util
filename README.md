===========================

This module provides basic bioinformatic tools for KBase users.


Examples of tools that will be developed in this module:

1) Blast a protein sequence against a genome

2) Generate GeneOntology annotation for a protein sequence, through InterproSCAN.

3) All-aganist-all sequence comparison between two genomes

4) Functional comparison between two genomes


Testing
===========================
1) provide user name and password in test/test.cfg

2) login as kbasetest

3) make test
