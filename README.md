Core Genome Utilities
===========================

A KBase module that exposes core KBase genome and feature utility methods, such as 
running Blast against a genome.



The name of this module should be changed.
'Core Genome' may refers to something oppsite to 'Pan Genome'.
Maybe change the name of this module to 'Genome Core Utilities' or 'Genome basic utilities' will be better for people to understand.
